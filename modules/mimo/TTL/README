Thank you for downloading the TTL library.  This library was developed
by the Geometry Group at SINTEF ICT, Department of Applied
Mathematics (http://www.sintef.no/math).

Requirements:
* Boost
  www.boost.org
* CMake
  www.cmake.org

A few comments on the current distribution:

(1) You can generate doxygen information by typing 'doxygen' in the base
    directory.
(2) In order to compile/install the library, you need to use CMake. See 
    the INSTALL file.
(3) In order to compile, you need to have the 'boost' library installed on 
    your system.
(4) For further information on the TTL library, see the file README-TTL.txt.

Good luck!
